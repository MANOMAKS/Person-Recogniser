# 🧠 AI-Powered Face Recognition with Spoof Detection

This project is an advanced face recognition system built using **Python**, **InsightFace (MobileFaceNet)**, and **OpenCV**. It can recognize known individuals and detect whether the input is from:
- 👤 A **live person** (webcam feed)
- 📱 A **screen photo** (e.g., from a phone or monitor)
- 🖼️ A **pre-existing image** (downloaded or printed)

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Face recognition using cosine similarity and embeddings
- 📸 Input via **image path** or **live webcam**
- 🔍 Detects input source type:
  - Live person
  - Mobile/computer screen
  - Downloaded/pre-existing photo
- 🧠 Uses FFT, Laplacian variance, brightness, edge detection for source classification
- 🗂️ Face data stored and loaded using Pickle

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- InsightFace (`buffalo_l` with MobileFaceNet)
- NumPy, SciPy
- scikit-learn

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-spoof-detection.git
pip install insightface opencv-python scikit-learn numpy scipy
python your_script.py

Note:
This project leverages the powerful MobileFaceNet-based buffalo_l model from InsightFace, where custom face embeddings are generated and trained using user-provided images to enable highly accurate and secure face recognition.
